## That's was hot ! 🔥

Few weeks, just a few weeks we had to prepare all pages on [LeMonde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr).

But at least I'm proud to show you how amazing these pages I've worked on are awesome :

- [Home page](https://www.lemonde.fr/resultats-elections/)
- [Per City](https://www.lemonde.fr/resultats-elections/meaux-77284/)
- [Some special ones](https://www.lemonde.fr/resultats-elections/paris-75056/)

Thanks to all the teams ! 🎉
