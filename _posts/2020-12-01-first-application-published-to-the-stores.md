## What a challenge

Last summer I've been engaged in the tech team of [L‘Obs](https://www.nouvelobs.com/) as a lead developper specially for
the mobile application.

I've always been a backend developper (and sometimes a fullstack, the swiss army knife) and they gave me the oportunity
to make the brand new version (4.0.0) of the app using React Native.

And today I've submitted the build to App Store & Play Store.
It has been chanllenging and I think I can be proud of this release (_even if it may be buggy but not as much as the old
version_).

To download it you can can go to :

- [Google Play Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lobs-actu-et-information/id361705445)
- [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lobs-actu-et-information/id361705445)
